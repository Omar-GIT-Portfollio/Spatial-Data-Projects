# Omar Spatial & Statistical Data Portfolio

This repository contains statistical and spatial data analysis work completed
using R and spatial statistics tools as part of GIS and data analysis coursework.

The focus of this repository is on applying, interpreting, and communicating
statistical methods commonly used in spatial and geographic analysis.

## Topics Covered

The reports in this repository cover:

- Probability distributions
- Sampling techniques
- Confidence intervals
- Hypothesis testing
- Correlation analysis
- Linear regression
- Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
- Spatial autocorrelation using GeoDa

Each PDF documents the analysis workflow, results, and interpretation.

## Tools Used

- R (statistical analysis)
- GeoDa (spatial autocorrelation)
- Statistical methods for spatial and non-spatial data
- Data interpretation and reporting

---

## Notes
